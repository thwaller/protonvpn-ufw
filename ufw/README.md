The files (2) contained within are for disabling IPv6 on the local machine should it be needed.

My testing has shown the better option is to disable IPv6 on the router is it is need vs disabling on the local machine. If the router will not pass IPv6, there is no leak ... at least this is what I have experienced. I am unsure if leaving IPv6 active for LAN purposes has any benefit, but I prefer to change as little as possible and avoid leaks the best I can.
